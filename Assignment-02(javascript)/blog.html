                <h3>Function Scope:</h3class=>
                <p >The variables which declared with var keyword are mainly function-scoped.We are only access them within the function where they are defined.</p>

                <h3>Hoisting:</h3class=>
                <p >Which variable are declared with keyword var hoisted to be top of their containing function or global scope.We can use them before they are declared but they are initially undefined until their actual declaration happend.</p>

               

                <h2 >2. Let : </h2>

                <h3>Block Scope: </h3class=>
                    <p >Which variable are declared with keyword let are block-scoped.that's meaned they are accessible only within the block where they are mainly defined.A block can be a function,loop etc.</p>
    
                <h3>Hoisting:</h3class=>
               <p >Unlike var, variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their containing block. They are only accessible after the point where they are declared.</p>

                <p >What sets const apart from var and let is its immutability after initialization. Once you assign a value to a const variable, you cannot reassign it.</p>

                <p >Immutability sets const apart from var and let after initialization. Once we assign a value to a const variable, we cannot reassign it.It will be fixed.</p>

                <h2>null: </h2>
                <p>"null" is often used for an intentional absence of any object value or to explicitly indicate the absence of a value. </p>
                <h3>1. Initializing Variables:</h3>
                <p>We can assign null variables if we want to indicate that they haven't been assigned a valid value yet. </p>

                <h3>2 .Resetting Values:</h3>
                <p>"null" can used to reset value of a variable or property to a empty state or to indicate - it is no longer considered valid.</p>

                <h3>3. Checking for Absence:</h3>
                <p>We use null to explicitly check if a variable or property missed or haven't set yet.</p>


                <h2>undefined: </h2>
                <p>"undefined" is a value which indicates a variable or property has been declared but haven't assigned any value or it can be "null".  </p>
                <h3>1. Default Value:</h3>
                <p>When a variable is declared, not assigned a value then it automatically assigned the value undefined.</p>

                <h3>2. Function Parameters: </h3>
                <p>If a function called with fewer arguments than declared parameters and the missing parameters are set to undefined.

                </p>

                <h3>3. Object Properties: </h3>
                <p>When we try to access an object property which isn't exist then the result is "undefined".

           <h1>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>


            <div id="blog-3" style="display: none;">


                <h2>What is a REST API?</h2>
                <p>REST is mainly "Representational State Transfer". It is an architectural style for designing networked applications and defines a set of constraints and principle to create web services.

                <p><span>Resources:</span> In REST, everything is considered a resource in a REST API.A resource can be a data ,or an object or services. Each resource is identified by a unique URL.</p>

                <p><span>HTTP Methods:</span> REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH to perform actions on resources. For example, GET is used to retrieve data, while POST is used to create new resources.</p>

                <p><span>Stateless:</span> REST is stateless means that each request from client to a server must contain all the information which needed to understand & process the request. </p>

                <p><span>Uniform Interface:</span> REST APIs have an uniform and consistent interface to work with them that makes it easier for developers by using standard HTTP status codes for responses.</p>
